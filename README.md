# BTS_A-Comparative-Analysis
This repository holds the survey of deep learning models being used for Brain Tumor Segmentation along with a comparative analysis of models

The paper discusses the details of Brain tumor tissue types, Glioma Tumor Analysis, the major challenges that are faced while performing tumor segmentation task. It gives the description of existing models focusing on both CNN approaches and integrated models of CNN and Transformers. The paper descibes the overview of deep models used for comparative study and conlcuding with the implementation results on Brain dataset.
